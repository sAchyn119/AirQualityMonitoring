# Air Quality Monitoring - Week 1 Project

This project is part of **AICTE Edunet Internship** under the theme **Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control**.

## Week 1 (30% Completion)
- Imported required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Loaded the dataset (`city_day.csv`)
- Performed data exploration using:
  - `.info()`
  - `.describe()`
  - `.isnull().sum()`
- Displayed sample data using `.head()`

## How to Run
1. Open this folder in **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Make sure `city_day.csv` is in the same folder as `Week1_Project.ipynb`.
3. Run the notebook step by step.

## Next Steps (Week 2)
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Visualization of trends (pollution levels by city/year)
